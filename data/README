Maybe it makes sense to put the grecco grid file here and maybe also a small example grid for quick tests
with just a few grid nodes and connected households.

At some time, Btissam wanted to include the heat pump data base in the package data.
This was never functional.
Hence, the files add to the repo when trying were deleted when introducing uv as project manager.
If the data is needed, I think the best way would be to move it into the source dir add control data adding with pyproject.toml.
